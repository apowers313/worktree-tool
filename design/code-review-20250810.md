# Code Review Report - 2025-08-10

## Executive Summary

This code review was conducted on the worktree-tool project after merging multiple feature branches. The review focused on identifying merge conflicts, lost functionality, code duplication, inconsistent implementations, and CI/local testing differences.

### Critical Issues (Priority 1)
1. **Merge Command Not Implemented** - The merge command exists but contains only stub code
2. **Duplicate Error Handling Functions** - Multiple error formatting functions exist across the codebase
3. **CI/Local Test Behavior Differences** - Tests behave differently in CI vs local environments

### High Priority Issues (Priority 2)
1. **Duplicate Sanitization Functions** - Multiple implementations of sanitization logic
2. **Type Definitions Scattered** - Some types defined locally instead of in core/types.ts
3. **Inconsistent Test Configuration** - Different timeout values and setup across test types

### Medium Priority Issues (Priority 3)
1. **Code Organization** - Some utility functions could be consolidated
2. **Test Coverage Gaps** - Some error paths not fully tested
3. **Documentation** - Missing JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Lost Functionality - Merge Command

**Location**: `src/commands/merge.ts`

The merge command appears to have lost its implementation during branch merges. The current implementation only contains:
```typescript
logger.info("Merge command not yet implemented");
```

**Impact**: Users cannot use the merge functionality that was advertised.

**Recommendation**: 
- Check git history for the original implementation
- Restore the merge command functionality
- Add comprehensive tests for merge scenarios

### 2. Duplicate Error Handling

**Locations**:
- `src/utils/error-handler.ts`: `getErrorMessage()`, `handleCommandError()`
- `src/utils/errors.ts`: `formatErrorMessage()`

Multiple functions perform similar error message extraction:
- `getErrorMessage()` - extracts error message from unknown type
- `formatErrorMessage()` - similar functionality with slightly different formatting

**Impact**: Code duplication, potential inconsistency in error formatting

**Recommendation**:
- Consolidate error formatting into a single function
- Use `getErrorMessage()` as the primary implementation
- Remove or deprecate `formatErrorMessage()`

### 3. CI vs Local Test Differences

**Locations**: 
- `test/integration/exec-modes.test.ts`
- `test/helpers/ci-mock.ts`
- Various test files checking `process.env.CI`

Tests have conditional behavior based on CI environment:
```typescript
const isCI = process.env.CI ?? process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS;
const expectedMode = isCI ? "exit" : "window";
```

**Impact**: Tests may pass locally but fail in CI, or vice versa

**Recommendation**:
- Mock CI detection consistently across all tests
- Test both CI and non-CI behaviors explicitly
- Remove environment-dependent assertions

### 4. Duplicate Sanitization Logic

**Locations**:
- `src/utils/sanitize.ts`: Generic sanitization functions
- `src/utils/project.ts`: `sanitizeProjectName()`, `sanitizeGitBranchName()`

Multiple implementations of name sanitization exist:
- Generic sanitize function with presets
- Specific sanitization functions duplicating logic

**Impact**: Maintenance burden, potential inconsistency

**Recommendation**:
- Use the generic `sanitize()` function with appropriate presets
- Remove duplicate implementations
- Update all callers to use the unified approach

### 5. Scattered Type Definitions

**Locations**:
- `src/core/types.ts` - Main type definitions
- `src/types/conflicts.ts` - Conflict-specific types
- Various files with local interface definitions

Type definitions are not consistently placed:
- Some interfaces defined locally in files where used
- Separate types directory created for conflicts

**Impact**: Harder to find and maintain type definitions

**Recommendation**:
- Move all shared types to `src/core/types.ts`
- Keep implementation-specific types with their implementations
- Consider organizing types by domain if the file gets too large

### 6. Test Sandbox Usage

**Positive Finding**: Most tests properly use the `TestSandbox` for isolation.

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Some unit tests could benefit from using the sandbox
- Ensure all file system operations happen within sandbox

### 7. Test Configuration Inconsistency

**Locations**:
- `vitest.config.ts` - No timeout specified
- `vitest.config.integration.ts` - 30 second timeout
- `vitest.config.e2e.ts` - 60 second timeout

**Recommendation**: 
- Document why different timeouts are needed
- Consider extracting shared configuration

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. Restore merge command implementation
2. Consolidate error handling functions
3. Fix CI/local test differences by mocking CI detection

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. Consolidate sanitization functions
2. Reorganize type definitions
3. Add missing tests for error paths

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. Create comprehensive API documentation
2. Refactor test configuration for consistency
3. Consider extracting shared test utilities

## Positive Findings

1. **Good Test Isolation** - The `TestSandbox` implementation is well-designed
2. **Comprehensive Error Types** - Custom error classes are well-structured
3. **Type Safety** - Good use of TypeScript throughout
4. **Command Pattern** - Clean implementation of command pattern with `BaseCommand`
5. **Platform Abstraction** - Good separation of platform-specific code

## Conclusion

The codebase is generally well-structured with good patterns in place. The main concerns are around code duplication from merging multiple branches and the missing merge command implementation. Addressing the critical and high-priority issues will significantly improve code maintainability and reliability.
